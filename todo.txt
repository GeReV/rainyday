# 1. Optimize unused droplet pool with a queue of unused indices.
# 2. Movement should be less prevalent.
3. Allow droplets to "shed" smaller droplets.
4. Bigger droplets should travel faster.
5. Droplets should be able to transfer some velocity on collision.
6. Droplets should have maximum size.
7. Make droplet spawning time-dependent instead of FPS-dependent.
8. Vapor wipe effect.
9. Collision ball larger than should be?
